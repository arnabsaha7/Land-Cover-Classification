This project utilizes Google Earth Engine to perform land cover classification for the region of Gujarat using the MODIS Land Cover Type dataset. It implements a Random Forest classifier to predict land cover types based on sampled data.

## Features

- Land cover classification using `MODIS` dataset
- Comapring a custom classified layer to landcover dataset
- Visualization of classified results
- Export of training points and classified results in GeoJSON format

| Map | Land Cover | Classified Land Cover |
|-----|------------|-----------------------|
| ![Map](images/map.png) | ![Land Cover](images/land_cover.png) | ![Classified Land Cover](images/classified_land_cover.png) |
| *Map of Gujarat*       | *Land Cover Types*       | *Classified Land Cover*    |

### Exported Data

- The classified land cover and training points are exported as GeoJSON files located in the `json` folder.
